"""Aggregated health warnings for the console banner.

The console shows a top-of-page banner when something the current
configuration *expects* is not actually healthy. Expectations follow
configuration, not a fixed list: services installed by default are always
expected; conditional services (code-sync) are expected exactly when their
feature is enabled — and conversely are flagged when running without their
feature enabled.
