"""Discard dead pre-warmed job processes from the livekit-agents ProcPool.

After macOS sleep, the ping watchdog kills every idle pre-warmed job process
("process is unresponsive, killing process"), but upstream ``ProcPool`` leaves
the dead executors in its warmed queue and counts them toward its idle
target. Every dispatched job then fails instantly with ``BrokenPipeError``
("failed to launch job on process after 3 attempts") — calls sit on "waiting
for agent" — and no replacements spawn until enough failed calls drain the
corpses. Upstream report: https://github.com/livekit/agents/issues/3841.

Two patch layers, both transparent for healthy processes:

- ``_acquire_proc`` skips dead executors instead of handing them to
  ``launch_job``, so the first call after wake self-heals instead of failing.
- A ``process_closed`` listener purges dead executors from the warmed queue
  so the pool's idle accounting stays honest and it re-warms right away.

The patch only applies to exact livekit-agents versions we have verified;
bumping the pin without revisiting this module logs an error and leaves the
stock (broken) behavior in place rather than patching blind.
