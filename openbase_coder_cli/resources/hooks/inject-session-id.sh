# SessionStart hook for the Openbase-managed Codex and Claude Code homes.
# Reads the session_id from the hook's stdin JSON and injects it into the
# conversation as additionalContext, together with the instructions for using
# it, so the agent knows its own thread/session ID and stamps commits with the
# Agent-Thread-Id trailer. The usage instructions ride in the hook (rather
# than in AGENTS.md) so they ship, update, and uninstall with it, and only
# appear in sessions where the ID actually exists.
