# Openbase

Openbase is a voice-first AI coding product. You talk to coding agents
from your iPhone or Mac while a local runtime on your computer runs the actual
coding sessions against your repositories.

These docs cover the whole product, not just the CLI:

- **[Desktop app](desktop-app.md)** — the macOS Electron app. Guided setup,
  and the main dashboard for projects, threads, reports, approvals, routines,
  skills, settings, and screen sharing.
- **[iOS app](ios-tabs.md)** — voice calls with the dispatcher and Super
  Agents, thread management, approvals, reports, and diffs from your phone.
- **[Web console & Openbase Cloud](console.md)** — the same dashboard in a
  browser, plus your account at `https://app.openbase.cloud`.
- **`openbase-coder` CLI** — the local runtime underneath all of the above: a
  Django API + WebSocket server, LiveKit voice services, and launchd/systemd
  service management. See [Commands](commands/index.md).

## Which Page Do I Need?

- Installing for the first time → [Getting Started](getting-started.md) or
  just [download the desktop app](downloads.md) and follow its setup flow.
- What can I do in the Mac app? → [Desktop App](desktop-app.md)
- What can I do on my phone? → [iOS App](ios-tabs.md)
- What is app.openbase.cloud for? → [Web Console & Cloud](console.md)
- Talking to agents by voice, transferring calls → [Voice Routing](voice-routing.md)
- Something is broken → [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)
- CLI flags and behavior → [Commands](commands/index.md)

## Quick Start

The easiest path is the desktop app: [download the Mac app](downloads.md),
open it, and follow the guided setup. It installs the bundled CLI, walks you
through choosing a coding backend and voice provider, signs you in, and pairs
your iPhone over Tailscale.

To set up from a terminal instead:

```bash
# Install the standalone macOS package
curl -fsSL https://github.com/openbase-community/openbase-coder/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh

# Bootstrap Openbase locally
openbase-coder setup

# Run server in foreground
openbase-coder server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7999
```

For source development, clone the workspace repo and run its setup script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openbase-community/openbase-coder-workspace
cd openbase-coder-workspace
./scripts/setup
```
