# Commands Overview

Many of these operations also have UI equivalents in the
[desktop app](../desktop-app.md) and [web console](../console.md) (service
control, backend and model selection, settings) and in the
[iOS app](../ios-tabs.md) (threads, approvals, voice). The CLI is the layer
underneath all of them.
