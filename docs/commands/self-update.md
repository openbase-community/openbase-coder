# self-update

Update a standalone Openbase install to the latest release for its
channel. The full contract (feed, atomicity, rollback, quiescing, channels,
signing) lives in the workspace `AUTO_UPDATE.md` guide.

In the apps: the [desktop app](../desktop-app.md#auto-update) updates itself
separately via Electron auto-update and shows a footer indicator when a CLI
update is available; the [iOS app](../ios-tabs.md) updates through
TestFlight/App Store.

## Usage

```bash
openbase-coder self-update            # update if a newer release exists
openbase-coder self-update --check    # check only; do not install
openbase-coder self-update --force    # update even during a voice session
openbase-coder self-update --json     # machine-readable result (UI-driven)
```

## Behavior

1. Refuses in development-workspace installs (git-managed; no auto-update).
2. Fetches `update-manifest.json` for the install's channel — `stable` from
   the latest GitHub release, `beta` from the newest release including
   prereleases — and verifies its Ed25519 signature when the build embeds the
   release public key.
3. Compares versions and honors `min_supported_version` and the package
   `layout_version`; a release with a newer layout than the updater
   understands is reported as `blocked` (reinstall via the desktop app or
   install.sh).
4. Defers when a voice session is active unless `--force` is passed.
5. Downloads the target tarball, verifies its SHA-256, extracts it to
   `~/.openbase/packages/standalone/releases/<version>-<target>/`, and
   smoke-runs the new launcher.
6. Atomically flips the `current` symlink, keeping the outgoing release
   behind `previous`, then regenerates and restarts services with the new
   CLI, rebuilds the plugin site when the bundled Python changed, and
   refreshes `~/.openbase/bin/codex` when Openbase installed it.
7. Rolls back to `previous` (and reinstalls services) if the post-update
   health gate fails; older releases are pruned, keeping two.

## Statuses

`updated`, `up-to-date`, `deferred` (voice session), `blocked` (newer package
layout), `rolled-back` (health gate failed; exit code 1).

## Related

- `GET /api/update/status/` (`?refresh=1` re-checks the feed) and
  `POST /api/update/apply/` expose the same functionality to the desktop app
  and console; apply runs detached and logs to `~/.openbase/logs/self-update.log`.
- Update flags also appear in the `versions` block of
  `GET /api/onboarding/status/`.
