# Web Console & Openbase Cloud

The Openbase Coder console is the dashboard UI. The
[desktop app](desktop-app.md) embeds it, the local runtime serves it in any
browser, and Openbase Cloud hosts your account at
`https://app.openbase.cloud`.

## Reaching the Console

- **Desktop app** — the dashboard is the console; no browser needed.
- **Local browser** — `http://127.0.0.1:7999` on the Mac running the
  runtime, or `http://<tailscale-host>:18080` from any device on your
  tailnet.
- **From the iOS app** — the Console tab opens the local console in an
  embedded browser with your CLI auth token injected automatically; the Diff
  tab opens the mobile-optimized diff view at `/mobile/diff`.

Authentication uses the local CLI token managed by `openbase-coder login`
and the runtime; the iOS app and desktop app handle this for you.

## Console Pages

The console serves the same pages as the desktop app dashboard — Overview,
Projects, Threads, Reports, Dispatch, Approvals, Routines, Skills,
Templates, Diff, Status, Devices, Instructions, Tools, Launchctl, and
Settings. See [Desktop App](desktop-app.md#the-dashboard) for the full tour,
including what each page can do on iPhone.

Differences in a browser:

- Electron-only features are absent: the guided onboarding flow, app
  auto-update notices, and LiveKit companion screen sharing.
- The Diff page supports a mobile layout (`/mobile/diff`), which is what the
  iOS Diff tab embeds.
- Plugins can register additional console pages, rendered as iframes; they
  appear in the sidebar when installed. See
  [plugins](commands/plugins.md).

Useful shortcuts: **Cmd/Ctrl+B** toggles the sidebar; in a thread,
**Enter** sends the prompt and **Shift+Enter** inserts a newline.

## Openbase Cloud (app.openbase.cloud)

`https://app.openbase.cloud` is your Openbase Cloud account. As a user you
touch it for:

- **Sign-in** — `openbase-coder login`, the desktop app, and the iOS app all
  authenticate against it via browser OAuth.
- **Device onboarding** — during setup your Mac registers itself here so the
  iOS app can find it ("Link Your Computer" pairing).
- **Subscription** — the Openbase Cloud coding backend and extras such as
  Apple Music playback during muted calls are tied to your cloud
  subscription.
- **Cloud DevSpace** — launching a cloud sandbox that runs the full Openbase
  runtime on Linux. See [Cloud DevSpace](cloud-devspace.md).

Both apps link to it directly: the desktop sidebar's **Cloud** item and the
iOS sidebar's **Cloud** tab.

Openbase Cloud also hosts deployment tooling, which is outside the scope of
these docs.

**On iPhone:** the Cloud tab opens app.openbase.cloud in the embedded
browser, and onboarding's "Start with Cloud" path uses it without any local
pairing.
